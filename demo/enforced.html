<h1>Enforced</h1>


<p>
  This page will load a script that is signed, and a script that is not
  signed. Because the page is enforcing a policy which restricts execution
  to scripts signed with a given key, the former will execute, the latter
  won't. SO EXCITING, RIGHT?!?
</p>

<ul>
  <li id="with-sig" style="color: red;">The signed script did not execute.</li>
  <li id="without-sig" style="color: red;">The unsigned script did not execute.</li>
</ul>

<a href="/unenforced">Try it without enforcement!</a>
